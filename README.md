## üóÇ Quick Comparison Table

| Azure Service                  | AWS Equivalent                            | GCP Equivalent                  | Notes |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------|
| **Microsoft Entra ID** (SSO/IAM) | AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)             | Google Cloud Identity            | Azure in hybrid AD; AWS mult-account; GCP close with Workspace |
| **Azure Monitor & Log Analytics** | Amazon CloudWatch + CloudTrail            | Google Cloud Operations Suite    | All the three offer observability, logs, and metrics |
| **Azure Policy**               | AWS Config + Service Control Policies (SCP) | Google Organization Policy       | Azure is of simple GUI; AWS is deeply integrated with Org accounts; GCP policy linked to resource hierarchy |
| **Defender for Cloud**         | AWS Security Hub + Inspector + GuardDuty   | Google Security Command Center   | Azure ‚Äì Unified cloud & hybrid posture; AWS ‚Äì Modular; GCP ‚Äì Identity & Workload security. |
| **Microsoft Sentinel** (SIEM/SOAR) | AWS Security Hub + OpenSearch SIEM stack  | Chronicle Security Operations    | Sentinel is their cloud native SIEM/SOAR, then you have AWS needs multiple tools, and GCP has this thing called cloud chronicler that's specifically big data security. |
